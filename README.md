# Google Summer of Code 2023 Final Submission

This document is a summary of the work that I did during my participation in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2023. The surrounding repository contains a lot more information on the details of what I have done.

## Summary

For me, the GSoCâ€™23 journey was an excellent learning experience. It was a terrific learning experience to work on an area that I'm very passionate about and where I have my core skills. Working actively on the enviroCar Android app and on the Rasa side, I was able to learn various aspects of the development of a feature such as:

- Working with a large codebase
- Writing clean, readable, and production-level code
- Working in a team to understand how a feature can be addressed using various techniques.

My experience participating in Google Summer of Code with LLVM Compiler Infrastructure organization has been enriching and significantly advanced my developer skills. I look forward to continuing to contribute to the feature and working to become a better developer.

I want to thank Mircea Trofin, Tarindu Jayatilaka, and Johannes Doerfert, my mentors, for being open to my ideas, looking over my code, reviewing my approaches, and helping me with implementations. Working with them was a remarkable learning experience and I was glad to be a mentee under them.

Ultimately, I would like to express my gratitude to the LLVM Compiler Infrastructure organization for providing me with this wonderful chance to spend my summer working on this project as part of GSoC 2023.
